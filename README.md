# HuffComp Project
This tool uses Huffman Encoding to compress and decompress files efficiently. It analyzes byte-level frequency in the file, builds a binary tree, and replaces frequently occurring bytes with shorter codes to reduce file size.

# Expected Compression Range
- **Text-based PDFs**: Up to 60–70% compression  
- **Image-heavy PDFs**: Around 20–40% compression  
- **Mixed content PDFs**: Typically 30–60% compression
